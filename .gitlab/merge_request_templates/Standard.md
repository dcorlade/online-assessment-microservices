#### <Description Template, remember to remove this and all parts that do not apply here>

### What is happening here?

(This merge request ensures that the newest added features in the Development branch are added to the testing
branch, so they can be tested. Also, this avoids merge conflicts once the testing branch is eventually merged into
Development, the other way)

### Why is that necessary?

(The JUnit testing branch has been existing for quite a long time, and is quite outdated.)

### Does this affect branches other than the source and the target branch?

(Only the testing branch is affected, Development is not deleted, and no other branch is affected.)

### Why are x approvals necessary?

(Since this merges the parent into the child, 0 approvals are needed.)

(This merge request closes issue #...)
